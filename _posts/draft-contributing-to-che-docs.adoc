== Contributing to Eclipse Che documentation

Writing about Eclipse Che is even easier than you think.
The link:https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-docs[Eclipse Che documentation repository on GitHub] was created with community contribution in mind
and has the tools
you need
to create and test your content.
What's more, from the initial draft to submitting a PR, you can do it all in the environment you're already familiar with: an Eclipse Che workspace.
